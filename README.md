# Project Movies

The goal of this assignment was to fetch movie data and present it as a multi page application.

## The problem

We started by creating components for different pages. Because this was a pair programming assignment we planned early in the week on how to use our time most efficiently.
During our first coding session we built the base structure for the pages and made all the functions work.
Secondly we worked on the styling and created extra components and functions to catch movies that are not found.

The app is built in React and the other languages used in this project is HTML5, JSX, CSS3 as well as some libraries from react-router-dom.

If we had more time we would create a loading page.
